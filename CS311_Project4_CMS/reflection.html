        <li>I struggled initially with foundations grid layout. It is similar to CSS grid, however,<br>
        it uses a 12 column structure. Foundation had several tutorials to help me learn the grid system,<br>
        making it much easier to use.
        </li>
        <li>I struggled with making the composer works column expand the full width of the page to create the<br>
            desired layout. However, foundation has easy syntax that allowed me to specify that i wanted the column<br>
            to be full height.
        </li>
        <li>
            After expanding the composer works column to be full height, i then ran into the issue of getting the layout<br>
            correct for the rest of the page. I solved this by making a smaller 8 column grid and placing the rest of the classes<br>
            inside of this grid.
        </li>
        <li>
            Foundations xy grid system made it fairly easy to get the desired layout, however, I actually think CSS grid layout<br>
            was a little easier to comprehend.
        </li>
        <li>
            This project was a nice refresher, since I haven't used html and css in a while. It took some research to remember how to<br>
            do certain things, but I got the hang of it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Another thing I struggled with was aligning text in the center vertically. I solved this by using a flex display and then <br>
            using the aligh-items command to center the text. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Overall, I like Foundations grid layout, however, I would need to spend much more time to figure out the power of it and to <br>
            feel comfortable with it.
